    Since {`we've`} had the chance to go over most of the basics of HTML and some of its common tags as well as CSS and I expect us to be quite familiar with the {`'property: value'`} principle as
    well in css. An assignment was assigned to us in other to test our knowledge about CSS. The deadline is thursday the 5<sup>th</sup> of October, 2023 and so I taught of dropping the prerequisite to
    the assignment here so we can be able to get through the basics before attempting the assignment.
