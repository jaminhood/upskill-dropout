    Flexbox, or Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model that allows you to design complex layouts with a more efficient and predictable way to distribute space and align content within a container,
    even when the size of your elements is unknown or dynamic. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive and horizontally or vertically centered layouts.
