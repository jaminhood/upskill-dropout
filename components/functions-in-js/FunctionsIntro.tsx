        Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take input in the form of parameters and can
        return a value or output. Functions help you organize and structure your code. They also allow for code reuse and make it easier to understand and maintain large codebases.
